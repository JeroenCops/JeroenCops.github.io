### Release

It's almost a month ago that I updated the website. I have been very busy with school. So I made slow
progress and I changed the look of the site. I wanted more color, so I added a moving gradient background.
I love it and it is so much better then that black, white, and green. Also some changes to the articles,
they are divided into categories and subcategories. It is easier to find the article you want to read and
find relative content to that article.
