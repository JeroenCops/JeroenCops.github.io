        I'm someone who loves to discover how things work and try to improve them.
        When I discovered how software was made, it let to an adventurous journey in modifying
        existing code and writing my own little programs.

        <h2 style="margin-top: 0">My education</h2>
        I'm currently studying Information Technologie at PXL University College.
        I'm learning a tremendous amount about programming on how to write clean and efficient code.
        It also helps me connect to people with the same interests and working together with
        those people on group projects.

        <h2 style="margin-top: 0">My knownledge</h2>
        Over the years, I learned several programming languages.
        I have experience with Functional programming and Object-oriented programming.
        The languages that I have worked with are:
        <ul>
          <li>Java</li>
          <li>C#</li>
          <li>Haskell</li>
        </ul>
        Currently, I'm still expanding my skill set with the Rust programming language, which I use for my personal projects.
        It helps me learn about memory management and write better performant code.
